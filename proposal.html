    <h1>Project Project Proposal</h1>
    <h4>What is your website about?</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>My website will be an informational website that will introduce the Weissman Scholarship and keep current and future Weissman Scholars at Babson College up to date with the news of the other scholars and the projects that have been completed and will be completed in the future. </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>What is the objective of your website?</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The objective of the website is to create a structure for the Project Proposal Process that other Weissman Scholars can follow because the current process is not very straightforward and help future scholars with their organization and idea creation. </li>
        <li>It will also serve as a way to network with past Weissman alumnus that could be helpful for current scholars and their professional development since these alumni are already working in the area that the current scholars are interested in. </li>
        <li>It also works the other way around where if any alumni wants to reach out to a current scholar, they can find the necessary information through the website. </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Who is your target audience?</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            My target audience are the current and past Weissman scholars at Babson College and the faculty in charge of the program
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>What content do you plan to include in each page of your website?</h4>
